# Dog_prediction

Overview:-

This project is a deep learning model that predicts the breed of a dog based on an input image of the dog's face. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze the visual features of the dog's face and make predictions. The model has been trained on a dataset of dog images obtained from Kaggle:-https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

Dataset:-

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the "Dog Breed Identification" dataset from Kaggle. It contains thousands of labeled images of various dog breeds. You can download the dataset from the following Kaggle competition page: Dog Breed Identification.
The dataset is organized into the following directories:
train: Contains labeled images of different dog breeds for training the model.
test: Contains unlabeled images for testing the model.

To run the code and perform dog breed predictions, you will need the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow (for building and training the CNN)
Keras (for constructing the deep learning model)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python pandas

Usage

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/NidhiBolia/Dog_prediction.git
